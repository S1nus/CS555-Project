# CS555-Project  
Command line python application that displays family tree information taken from a GEDCOM file in readable tables.

# Useful scripts
Clone the directory, place any gedcom file you would like to use for the application into gedcom_files.
TO run the following scripts, make sure the "scripts" directory is your active directory when doing so:

python gedcom_app.py - to run the interactive command line appp

python all_tests.py - to run all unit tests in scripts directory

To use the app, enter the name of the GEDCOM file you would like to view (active directory must be scripts, gedcom file must be in gedcom_files, and do not include path in the file name).

To run individual unit tests, enter the scripts directory and run the test_*.py file corresponding to the user story you want to test.
